    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
    <p>My childhood was like that of many other kids. My family, which had seven members in total, included three girls and four boys. I grew up in Malolos, Bulacan, a small town with no big buildings, just tall grass like a province. I spent my days going to school and playing with my friends. One of my friends, who I was really close with, was named Niel. We would always explore, catching all sorts of bugs, but mainly mga gagamba. Minsan ang buhay ay mahirap, especially when there was not enough food to eat. Pero it wasnt as bad as what some other kids go through. This was taught to me, kaya kahit ngayon hirap kami, I’m still thankful. Nag-aral ako sa Saint Clement High School where I learned not only from books but also from the people around me. My parents worked hard to support us and always tried to provide for our needs. Even though we didn’t have much, they taught us the value of hard work and staying strong. I spent a lot of time with my siblings and friends, and we enjoyed each other's company. Even though there were challenges, I always felt safe and loved because of my family. My parents made sure we had what we needed, even if it meant they had less. Growing up, I learned the importance of being thankful for the little things, like spending time with my family or watching the sunset. I realized that even in tough times, there were many things to be grateful for. Yung kabataan ko is not perfect, pero it taught me important lessons. The love and care of my family helped me through difficult moments. Natuto ako na no matter how hard life gets, we can always find ways to make it through. Those early years shaped me into who I am today, and I am thankful for them.

    <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
    <p>Nung ako ay nag-binata na, maraming bagay ang nagpabago sakin. My family moved to Quezon City, and for a while, we lived in my grandparents' house. Later, then lumipat kami sa condo called El Pueblo, where I started studying at Kings Montessori School. It was at this school that I met my friends na kahit ngayon ay tropa ko pa rin still to this day. However, my teenage years were not always easy. I became addicted to playing computer games, which caused me to neglect my studies. Because of this, I almost didn’t graduate from high school. I didn’t pay much attention to my schoolwork, I became bulakbol and didn’t care about my future. However, my family and friends didn’t give up on me. They encouraged me to change my ways and focus on my studies. With their support, I slowly began to improve. I realized na I don’t want this addiction for my future me. Thanks to my family’s help din that, I started paying more attention in class. I worked hard and eventually graduated from high school. I can say na hindi perfect ang teenage years ko, pero alam ko rin na walang perfect, pero they taught me very valuable lessons about responsibility and focusing on my future. I learned that it’s okay to make mistakes, as long as we learn from them. I am grateful to my friends and family for never giving up on me. Their support helped me realize my potential and pushed me to be better.

    <h3>College Years</h3>
    <p>Now that I am in college, things are a little different. Nag-aaral ako ngayon sa University of the East or UE Manila, which is a medyo well-known school. It’s not easy to manage school and work, pero I do my best. After ng pandemic, life became much harder, and my family needed extra income. I now work while studying to help support my family. My Kuya is the only one na tapos na sa college dahil hindi siya naabutan ng K-12 system. Were all doing our best to get by. College is tough because I have a lot of homework, and the classes are challenging as an IT. After school, I go straight agad sa trabaho for a catering service, and sometimes I don’t get home until late. I don’t have much time to rest, and minsan nami-miss ko yung mga time na I spent with my friends. I try to make the most of every moment, but it’s hard to balance everything. Despite the struggles, alam ko na that working hard now will pay off in the future. My college years have taught me how to manage my time better and handle stress. I also realized that walang mahihita sa madali, and I must work for what I want. Even though nakakapagod na minsan, I keep going because I know this is a step toward a better future. I am learning important lessons that will help me later in life. Although it's difficult, I’m determined to succeed. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’m excited for what lies ahead. College is helping me grow, at ako ay naniniwala na I can handle whatever challenges come my way.
